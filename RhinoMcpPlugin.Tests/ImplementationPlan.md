# RhinoMcpPlugin Unit Tests Implementation Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for creating comprehensive unit tests for the RhinoMcpPlugin. We've already established a test project structure and created several sample test classes that demonstrate the testing approach. This plan will guide the completion of the full test suite.

## 2. Current Progress

We have created:

1. A test project structure with appropriate references
2. Mock implementations for Rhino objects (MockRhinoDoc and related classes)
3. Sample test classes for:
   - RhinoUtilities (color parsing, object properties, etc.)
   - RhinoSocketServer (server start/stop, command processing)
   - RhinoMcpPlugin (lifecycle management, event handling)

## 3. Next Steps

### 3.1. Complete Mock Implementations

1. Enhance MockRhinoDoc to better simulate Rhino document behavior
2. Create additional mock classes for other Rhino services
3. Implement mock network clients for testing the socket server

### 3.2. Complete Test Classes

#### RhinoUtilities Tests
- Implement remaining tests for utility functions
- Add more edge cases and error scenarios

#### RhinoSocketServer Tests
- Add tests for multiple simultaneous connections
- Add tests for handling malformed JSON
- Add tests for all supported command types

#### RhinoMcpPlugin Tests
- Add tests for error handling during load/unload
- Add tests for plugin initialization with different Rhino states

#### GeometryTools Tests
- Create tests for sphere, box, and cylinder creation
- Test validation of geometric parameters
- Test error handling for invalid geometry

#### SceneTools Tests
- Test scene information retrieval
- Test scene clearing functionality
- Test layer creation and management

#### Command Tests
- Test command registration
- Test command execution
- Test user interface interactions

### 3.3. Test Infrastructure

1. Create test helpers for common setup and assertions
2. Implement test fixtures for shared resources
3. Set up test data generation for consistent test inputs

## 4. Testing Approach

### 4.1. Test Isolation

All tests should be isolated, with no dependencies on other tests. Each test should:
1. Set up its test environment
2. Perform the test action
3. Assert the expected outcome
4. Clean up any resources

### 4.2. Mocking Strategy

We'll use two approaches to mocking:
1. Custom mock implementations (like MockRhinoDoc) for core Rhino objects
2. Moq library for simpler dependencies and interfaces

### 4.3. Test Naming Convention

Tests should follow a consistent naming pattern:
```MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior
```

For example:
- `ParseHexColor_ValidHexWithHash_ReturnsCorrectColor`
- `Start_WhenCalled_ServerStarts`

### 4.4. Test Categories

Tests should be categorized using NUnit's `Category` attribute to allow running specific test groups:
- `[Category("Utilities")]`
- `[Category("SocketServer")]`
- `[Category("Plugin")]`
- `[Category("Geometry")]`
- `[Category("Commands")]`

## 5. Test Execution

Tests can be run using:
1. Visual Studio Test Explorer
2. NUnit Console Runner
3. Continuous Integration pipelines

## 6. Dependencies

The test project depends on:
- NUnit for test framework
- Moq for mocking
- RhinoCommon for Rhino API access

## 7. Challenges and Mitigations

### 7.1. RhinoCommon Mocking

**Challenge**: RhinoCommon classes are not designed for testing and many have sealed methods or complex dependencies.

**Mitigation**: Create custom mock implementations that inherit from Rhino classes where possible, and use interfaces or adapter patterns where inheritance is not possible.

### 7.2. Socket Server Testing

**Challenge**: Testing network communication can be flaky and dependent on timing.

**Mitigation**: Use appropriate timeouts, retry logic, and dedicated test ports to avoid conflicts.

### 7.3. RhinoDoc Environment

**Challenge**: Many plugin functions depend on an active RhinoDoc.

**Mitigation**: Create a robust MockRhinoDoc that can simulate the Rhino document environment.

## 8. Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Complete mock implementations and test infrastructure
2. **Week 2**: Implement core test cases for all components
3. **Week 3**: Add edge cases, error scenarios, and improve test coverage
4. **Week 4**: Review, refine, and document the test suite

## 9. Success Criteria

The test implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All core functionality has test coverage
2. Tests run reliably without flakiness
3. Test code is maintainable and follows best practices
4. Documentation is complete and accurate
5. CI pipeline includes automated test execution
